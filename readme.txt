ICT 3715 FINAL PROJECT UNISA

Develop a Student Exam portal system for the university of south africa.

I have chosen to develop a standard system using PHP and MySQL. One of 
the reasons for using PHP instead of vb net is performance issues that I have experienced on my laptop 
due to vb net’s more complex graphical user interface. I feel that I would experience similar problems 
using the Power Apps route. I am using relational database and windows operating system.

Why using MySQL
MySQL works well, a robust, relational DB which scales nicely to 100s of millions of rows. Plus, many 
web developers are familiar with using it so there is no shortage of expertise when the system is handed 
over to different groups of people to work on. There is a 30 days trial as in Azure after which a monthly 
premium is required, we as students don’t need to pay this extra cost when MySQL is free and opensource software under the terms of the GNU General Public License. MySQL has a wide compatibility 
with windows, iinux and mac.

After installing XAMPP, i had a problem connecting Apache to port 80.
After checking which ports are used and free by using Netstat,
Port 80 was used by system so i configured XAMPP to iisten on PORT 8081 Instead.
Apache and MySql run perfectly, checked using local host from browser.
